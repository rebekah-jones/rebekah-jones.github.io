  abstract: "One of the most enduring critiques of American policing is its uneven responsiveness to communities at the racial and economic margins---those often most in need of public safety services yet least empowered to demand and influence them. This study investigates how institutional reforms aimed at reducing participatory inequality affect racial disparities in policing outcomes across California municipalities. I exploit two exogenous shifts linked to increased turnout among racially minoritized groups: (1) the adoption of district-based elections following the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), and (2) statewide mandates transitioning local elections from off-cycle to on-cycle timing. Using these reforms as quasi-natural experiments, I find that efforts to broaden civic participation are associated with modest improvements in police responsiveness, as measured by overall clearance rates. However, these gains do not consistently extend to more acute indicators of service equity---such as racial inequality in homicide clearance rates and 911 response times. Notably, the shift to district elections appears to exacerbate representational inequality. To explore potential mechanisms, I analyze municipal deliberation patterns using text data from city council meeting minutes. Findings suggest that representational venues themselves may reinforce disparities in public service responsiveness, even in the wake of formal institutional reform."

  abstract: "Does spatial proximity to violence mobilize or depress individuals for political action? While research across the social sciences has illuminated the various forms of social isolation that characterize high-violence American neighborhoods, the democratic consequences of proximate exposure to violence have not been well understood. Merging voter files in U.S. cities and geocoded crime data, I test whether living in close proximity to sites of homicides affects one's likelihood of voting in federal elections. Employing a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) design, I provide causal evidence that close residential proximity to homicide depresses turnout by roughly four to six percentage points, with the strongest effects observed in plurality-Black block groups and those involving a Black victim. In further mechanism tests, I analyze 1) foot-traffic data aggregated by census block groups to examine how violence exposure affects population movement and 2) crime-linked survey data. Together, the analyses provide significant evidence that the unequal psychological burden of fear, shaped by an individual's perception of their risk of victimization, may drive social isolation and the observed negative effects. Generally, I consider how persistently high and spatially concentrated rates of violence in the United States shape patterns of political participation in race-class subjugated communities and affect democratic health more broadly.

  abstract: "American federalism affords lower-level jurisdictions tremendous flexibility in how policies are implemented. In some cases, this can allow for tailoring of policies to be contextually appropriate, innovative, and effective for their specific populations. In others, however, variation in how policies are implemented can result in unevenly distributed social and economic outcomes with significant implications for governance and inequality. Using detailed data from the California Department of Justice, we examine the impacts of a major state policy reform designed to reduce imprisonment, AB109. We find wide variation in the local effects of reform: we estimate that if all arrests had been made in the most lenient county, the result would have been 80% fewer prison sentences. In contrast, if all arrests had been made in the most punitive county, prison sentences would have increased by 150%. We also consider how variation in local implementation affected one of the most democratically destructive features of the American criminal justice system: racial inequality. Once we factor in local decision making, we find that racial disparities in total imprisonment actually increased following reform. These findings help clarify the important role federalism can play in determining the effects of public policy, in ways that can exacerbate racial disparities and potentially erode the legitimacy of law."
