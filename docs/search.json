No matter where your life or career takes you, you will need to rely on analyzing and interpreting data -- be it understanding how persuasive a study summarized in a news article is, making a case before a judge, deciding which voters to target in your political campaign, as a political leader trying to decide what policy best serves your constituents, or as a political scientist trying to understand how politics works. The purpose of this class is to equip you to better understand how to gather and interpret data that speaks to important questions of all kinds. Much of the course, although not all of it, will focus on applications in political science, teaching you how to pose and answer political science research questions in a rigorous way.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      PS 109-B: The Politics of Public Policy \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        Summer 2025.

How can advocates craft effective political strategies to influence government policy? &lt;br&gt; This course focuses on understanding the political forces that shape public policy, including interest groups, public pressure, political parties, and voters. In contrast to a public policy course, this course will not consider what ideal public policies should be, but rather consider why governments make the policies they do. &lt;br&gt; This course is suitable for anyone interested in politics or policy. Students will learn tools that will allow them to think like political strategists and understand how they and others influence government in practice.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Syllabus\n         \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Section Syllabus\n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      PS 109-E: The US Executive Branch and its Political Environment \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        Spring 2025.

Much of what the law actually says is decided in the executive branch, and almost all of it it implemented there. This involves the bureaucracy as well as (often more than) the president. Because implementation of policy defines what policy is, other parts of the government try to influence what the executive branch does, and different parts of the executive branch try to influence each other. &lt;br&gt; The course is structured around three major components. First, we will look at the executive branch with a focus on the president. We will analyze the president’s incentives and constraints in controlling the executive branch, and how presidents’ responses have changed American politics. Second, we will examine the executive branch with a focus on the bureaucracy. We will examine the paths by which bureaucrats make policy, and the ways that other actors try to influence them. Third, we will focus on two case studies to examine the ideas we develop in practice: one on national security and defense policy, one on immigration policy and enforcement.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Syllabus\n         \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Section Syllabus\n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items"

This academic year (2024-2025), I’m also a Berkeley Empirical Legal Studies (BELS) Graduate Fellow at the Center for Study of Law and Society (CSLS).\nI study how local political institutions shape the allocation of public goods—and how those distributions, in turn, affect how groups experience and participate in democratic systems. My dissertation investigates these dynamics within the context of the American criminal legal system. Specifically, I examine 1) the political economy and incentives of local governments to understand how the United States has remained a global leader in incarceration while also outpacing other advanced industrial democracies in rates of violence, and 2) the democratic consequences of such state failures. I do so using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, including spatial analysis, interviews, and causal inference designs.\nMore broadly, I’m interested in local politics, comparative political economy, political geography, and public policy. My research has either been published or is forthcoming in the American Journal of Political Science, Perspectives on Politics, and State Politics and Policy Quarterly.\nPrior to coming to Berkeley, I received a B.S. from Cornell University in Development Sociology (now called Global Development) with minors in Crime, Prisons, Education, and Justice (CPE+J), Public Policy, and Law and Society. Outside of academia, I love writing music and connecting with other artists."

Little attention has been devoted to the potential mechanisms driving these effects. Previous research suggests that electoral influence, conceptualized as an underrepresented group's relative size in a given political unit, can lead to an increase in turnout and subsequent descriptive representation. This article leverages ecological inference with nearest-neighbor matching and difference-in-differences methods to determine whether increased electoral influence following a switch from at-large to by-district elections as a result of the CVRA increased turnout among underrepresented groups. In my analysis, I find initial evidence suggesting that there is indeed a causal link between a CVRA-induced change in electoral institution and a reduction in the turnout gap. I do not find evidence to support my hypothesis that an increase in relative group size leads to a decrease in the turnout gap. I also do not find evidence to support my hypothesis that the effects of a switch to by-district elections on the turnout gap are more pronounced in cities where a minority group is a higher than average share of the total population. Instead, I find evidence that the treatment effects are more pronounced in cities where Hispanics are a lower than average share of the total population. In this work, I evaluate how the CVRA affects local California electorates, explain potential explanations for my findings and discuss potential areas for future research.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n            PDF \n        \n       \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n            Publisher's Version \n        \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items"

How might this troubling trend affect political participation and attitudes? Previous research finds that out-group threats might increase the salience of group-based identities and consequently shape political attitudes, group cohesion, and behavior (Huddy 2013), but reach mixed conclusions on whether these events are politically mobilizing or demobilizing. To investigate, I pair data encoding the geographic placement of hate crimes from 2010-2022 with individual-level turnout data to causally identify whether local hate crimes increased turnout among Asian Americans. To test potential mechanisms, I design an original survey experiment to estimate how the increased salience of hate crimes affects measures of Asian pan-ethnicity, stated vote likelihood, partisan identity and strength, and other behavioral outcomes. I find that hate crimes can strengthen group cohesion among the targeted group, but limited evidence that hate crimes have politically mobilized the targeted group and null effects on partisanship. I conclude that identity is a more complex motivator of partisanship and American electoral politics than previous studies might suggest.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Can Ending At-Large Elections Encourage Racial Minorities To Run For Office? \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          May 10, 2025.

Previous research on descriptive representation focuses on voter choices at the ballot box and attributes the paucity of minority candidates to voter bias. At the same time, given findings that at-large elections can diminish racial minorities' political power and candidates selectively run in favorable political landscapes, institutional electoral rules might contribute to the persistent disparity in racial representation among candidates. Despite these expectations, the dynamics under which electoral institutions shape candidate emergence among racial minorities remains understudied. I utilize the switch from at-large to by-district city council elections under the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 to causally identify how and under what conditions switching to by-district elections encourages racial minorities to run for local office. The evidence suggests that ending at-large elections under the CVRA increased both the number and percent share of Latino candidates among city council candidates, and boosted the rates at which Latino candidates won city council elections. These effects are strongest in cities where Latinos are more than 20 percent of the population. I also find evidence to suggest that ending at-large elections increased candidate emergence among Asian Americans in cities where Asian Americans are more than 50 percent of the citywide population. These findings highlight the importance of candidate emergence as a crucial mechanism driving descriptive representation and suggest policy interventions targeting candidate recruitment might be as important as those addressing voter participation.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Local Diversity and Political Participation \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          May 5, 2025.

Many studies examine the effects of cues from party leaders on policy preferences and cast voters as party loyalists, but rarely compare information from party leaders to information from other political and nonpartisan sources and thus cannot disentangle whether people rationally update their preferences or blindly follow party leaders. To investigate, I vary cues to identify the comparative strength of party leader cues and test issue importance and previous knowledge as potential moderators. I find that when asked to support or oppose a discrete policy, partisans respond to cues from party leaders but not other cues. When respondents respond with a continuous range of policy preferences, however, party leader cues are not inherently stronger — and are sometimes weaker — than cues from other sources. I find limited evidence to suggest either issue importance or political knowledge significantly moderates partisan sensitivity to elite cues, no matter the source. These results suggest that while party leaders draw partisans to express support for individual policy planks, leaders’ influence on underlying beliefs is far more complicated and voters engage in more cognition than previously suggested.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n1"
