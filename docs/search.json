No matter where your life or career takes you, you will need to rely on analyzing and interpreting data -- be it understanding how persuasive a study summarized in a news article is, making a case before a judge, deciding which voters to target in your political campaign, as a political leader trying to decide what policy best serves your constituents, or as a political scientist trying to understand how politics works. The purpose of this class is to equip you to better understand how to gather and interpret data that speaks to important questions of all kinds. Much of the course, although not all of it, will focus on applications in political science, teaching you how to pose and answer political science research questions in a rigorous way.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      PS 109-B: The Politics of Public Policy \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        Summer 2025.

How can advocates craft effective political strategies to influence government policy? &lt;br&gt; This course focuses on understanding the political forces that shape public policy, including interest groups, public pressure, political parties, and voters. In contrast to a public policy course, this course will not consider what ideal public policies should be, but rather consider why governments make the policies they do. &lt;br&gt; This course is suitable for anyone interested in politics or policy. Students will learn tools that will allow them to think like political strategists and understand how they and others influence government in practice.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Syllabus\n         \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Section Syllabus\n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      PS 109-E: The US Executive Branch and its Political Environment \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        Spring 2025.

Much of what the law actually says is decided in the executive branch, and almost all of it it implemented there. This involves the bureaucracy as well as (often more than) the president. Because implementation of policy defines what policy is, other parts of the government try to influence what the executive branch does, and different parts of the executive branch try to influence each other. &lt;br&gt; The course is structured around three major components. First, we will look at the executive branch with a focus on the president. We will analyze the president’s incentives and constraints in controlling the executive branch, and how presidents’ responses have changed American politics. Second, we will examine the executive branch with a focus on the bureaucracy. We will examine the paths by which bureaucrats make policy, and the ways that other actors try to influence them. Third, we will focus on two case studies to examine the ideas we develop in practice: one on national security and defense policy, one on immigration policy and enforcement.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Syllabus\n         \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n           Section Syllabus\n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items"

While research across the social sciences has illuminated the various forms of social isolation that characterize high-violence American neighborhoods, the democratic consequences of proximate exposure to violence have not been well understood. Merging voter files in U.S. cities and geocoded crime data, I test whether living in close proximity to sites of homicides affects one's likelihood of voting in federal elections. Employing a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) design, I provide causal evidence that close residential proximity to homicide depresses turnout by roughly four to six percentage points, with the strongest effects observed in plurality-Black block groups and those involving a Black victim. In further mechanism tests, I analyze 1) foot-traffic data aggregated by census block groups to examine how violence exposure affects population movement and 2) crime-linked survey data. Together, the analyses provide significant evidence that the unequal psychological burden of fear, shaped by an individual's perception of their risk of victimization, may drive social isolation and the observed negative effects. Generally, I consider how persistently high and spatially concentrated rates of violence in the United States shape patterns of political participation in race-class subjugated communities and affect democratic health more broadly. \n            \n          \n        \n        \n            PDF \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Can Local Electoral Reforms Improve Police Responsiveness? \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Jun 10, 2025.

This study investigates how institutional reforms aimed at reducing participatory inequality affect racial disparities in policing outcomes across California municipalities. I exploit two exogenous shifts linked to increased turnout among racially minoritized groups: (1) the adoption of district-based elections following the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), and (2) statewide mandates transitioning local elections from off-cycle to on-cycle timing. Using these reforms as quasi-natural experiments, I find that efforts to broaden civic participation are associated with modest improvements in police responsiveness, as measured by overall clearance rates. However, these gains do not consistently extend to more acute indicators of service equity---such as racial inequality in homicide clearance rates and 911 response times. Notably, the shift to district elections appears to exacerbate representational inequality. To explore potential mechanisms, I analyze municipal deliberation patterns using text data from city council meeting minutes. Findings suggest that representational venues themselves may reinforce disparities in public service responsiveness, even in the wake of formal institutional reform.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Bargain Policing: How Local Fiscal Inequality Sorts Officer Quality in Law Enforcement Labor Markets \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Jun 5, 2025.

Scholars have long observed that reliance on local tax bases can deepen fiscal inequality, weakening the equitable provision of public goods and encouraging affluent residents to exit communities with greater social spending needs. While existing research has focused on how fiscal inequality shapes public goods provision through patterns of residential sorting, I use the case of policing to highlight an underexplored mechanism: uneven capacity to compete for human capital in the public sector. Using detailed officer-level data alongside financial and administrative records from 15 states, I examine how fiscal inequality shapes local governments’ capacity to attract and retain police personnel in the law enforcement labor market. I find that fiscal disparities not only undermine staffing stability but also lead to significant differences in the qualifications of incoming officers, with downstream effects on crime rates, arrest patterns, and officer complaints. Together, the findings offer new insight into the structural roots of uneven policing in the United States and the hidden costs of decentralized governance.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Examining the Consequences of Fragmented Reform: Local Variation in California’s Public Safety Realignment \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          May 5, 2025.

In some cases, this can allow for tailoring of policies to be contextually appropriate, innovative, and effective for their specific populations. In others, however, variation in how policies are implemented can result in unevenly distributed social and economic outcomes with significant implications for governance and inequality. Using detailed data from the California Department of Justice, we examine the impacts of a major state policy reform designed to reduce imprisonment, AB109. We find wide variation in the local effects of reform: we estimate that if all arrests had been made in the most lenient county, the result would have been 80% fewer prison sentences. In contrast, if all arrests had been made in the most punitive county, prison sentences would have increased by 150%. We also consider how variation in local implementation affected one of the most democratically destructive features of the American criminal justice system: racial inequality. Once we factor in local decision making, we find that racial disparities in total imprisonment actually increased following reform. These findings help clarify the important role federalism can play in determining the effects of public policy, in ways that can exacerbate racial disparities and potentially erode the legitimacy of law.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n    \n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n[^1]"

This study investigates how institutional reforms aimed at reducing participatory inequality affect racial disparities in policing outcomes across California municipalities. I exploit two exogenous shifts linked to increased turnout among racially minoritized groups: (1) the adoption of district-based elections following the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), and (2) statewide mandates transitioning local elections from off-cycle to on-cycle timing. Using these reforms as quasi-natural experiments, I find that efforts to broaden civic participation are associated with modest improvements in police responsiveness, as measured by overall clearance rates. However, these gains do not consistently extend to more acute indicators of service equity---such as racial inequality in homicide clearance rates and 911 response times. Notably, the shift to district elections appears to exacerbate representational inequality. To explore potential mechanisms, I analyze municipal deliberation patterns using text data from city council meeting minutes. Findings suggest that representational venues themselves may reinforce disparities in public service responsiveness, even in the wake of formal institutional reform.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Bargain Policing: How Local Fiscal Inequality Sorts Officer Quality in Law Enforcement Labor Markets \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Jun 5, 2025.

Scholars have long observed that reliance on local tax bases can deepen fiscal inequality, weakening the equitable provision of public goods and encouraging affluent residents to exit communities with greater social spending needs. While existing research has focused on how fiscal inequality shapes public goods provision through patterns of residential sorting, I use the case of policing to highlight an underexplored mechanism: uneven capacity to compete for human capital in the public sector. Using detailed officer-level data alongside financial and administrative records from 15 states, I examine how fiscal inequality shapes local governments’ capacity to attract and retain police personnel in the law enforcement labor market. I find that fiscal disparities not only undermine staffing stability but also lead to significant differences in the qualifications of incoming officers, with downstream effects on crime rates, arrest patterns, and officer complaints. Together, the findings offer new insight into the structural roots of uneven policing in the United States and the hidden costs of decentralized governance.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Examining the Consequences of Fragmented Reform: Local Variation in California’s Public Safety Realignment \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          May 5, 2025.

In some cases, this can allow for tailoring of policies to be contextually appropriate, innovative, and effective for their specific populations. In others, however, variation in how policies are implemented can result in unevenly distributed social and economic outcomes with significant implications for governance and inequality. Using detailed data from the California Department of Justice, we examine the impacts of a major state policy reform designed to reduce imprisonment, AB109. We find wide variation in the local effects of reform: we estimate that if all arrests had been made in the most lenient county, the result would have been 80% fewer prison sentences. In contrast, if all arrests had been made in the most punitive county, prison sentences would have increased by 150%. We also consider how variation in local implementation affected one of the most democratically destructive features of the American criminal justice system: racial inequality. Once we factor in local decision making, we find that racial disparities in total imprisonment actually increased following reform. These findings help clarify the important role federalism can play in determining the effects of public policy, in ways that can exacerbate racial disparities and potentially erode the legitimacy of law.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n1"
